## A bit about me..

Based in Gods Own County, West Yorkshire, I have had an interest in web and web development for the last 20 years.  During the summer I started to take my learning up a level and self taught myself some PHP and increased my skills in HTML, CSS and SCSS.  Using thh skills I learnt I built my wife a website for her business, [Charlie's Gents Barbers](https://www.charliesbrighouse.com), using wordpress, with a fully custom theme.

I currently work as an office coordinator for a small local charity which supportds families with disabled children.
